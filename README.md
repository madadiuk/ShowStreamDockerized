Additional Notes


## Integration Tasks:

Ensure integration between components, particularly where tables overlap in responsibilities. For instance, content added or modified in the Content Management System must be correctly referenced in the Download and Transaction Management system.
Security and Data Integrity: Each developer must ensure that data integrity is maintained in their components, especially where foreign keys and relationships are involved.
Collaborative Testing: Coordinate testing across components to ensure that the system functions cohesively as a whole. This includes testing end-to-end workflows from user registration (handled by Student A) through content browsing and management (handled by Student B) to content downloading and transaction processing (handled by Student C).
